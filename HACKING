	you want to use emacs' -*- outline -*- mode, to read this ...

* first things first
** you're welcome to participate in progressing cvsfs4hurd
   if you got questions concerning it, don't hesitate but send me
   a mail to ssiegl@gmx.de

** cvsfs4hurd's code is real crap!
*** do you think so? please tell me what you don't like
    cvsfs4hurd is actually my first project, related to the
    Hurd and actually my first step towards OS-near programming.

** cvs_*.[ch] files should stay GNU Hurd independant
   that is, please use POSIX compatible code in those files to keep those
   portable. The other stuff (cvsfs.c, node.c, netfs.c at the time of this
   writing) is OS (aka Hurd) specific and probably needs to completely be
   rewritten when aiming to port to some other platform.

** source code documentation
   all functions in all of cvsfs4hurd's files should be well documented,
   this unfortunately isn't the case currently.  if you want to, you may
   supply some however.  when implementing new stuff, just write it first,
   so that won't happen in future ;)

* todos
** available stuff left to fix
*** urgent
**** add command line parameter to specify cvs user
     the password however shouldn't be supplyable through command line,
     since it would be readable using ps Aux.  read from $HOME/.cvspass
     instead.

**** correctly handle timestamps
***** update atimes where necessary

***** keep timestamp in netnode
      to prevent files from getting assigned a new timestamp when it's 
      node was freed, after all references were removed.  perhaps assigning
      time of translator startup or underlying node's mtime is worth 
      considering.

***** use timestamp from cvs repository
      how to find that out in a cheap way? rdiff doesn't tell, perhaps
      status does?? exporting is little bitty tooo expensive, I guess ...

*** things that can wait
**** show correct filesizes in stats
     ... not just a plain boring 'zero'. However to find out the files's
     sizes we probably have to download the file itself. Look for a way,
     cvs tells the filesize itself ...

** new features
   these are somewhat in order of urgency ...

*** support cvs access over ssh (ext), not only pserver

*** write support
**** try layering unionsfs/shadowfs on top
     in order to e.g. 'make' in a source directory.  we probably have to fix
     timestamp handling, in order to make use of make, don't we?

     write some documentation on that.

**** supply <filenode>/commit node
     if user writes to there, use this message as loginfo

*** make loginfo accessible some way
    (<filenode>/history or something)

*** allow revision access like Linux' cvsfs does
    (using @@ appendixes)


jupp, enough for the time being ...
