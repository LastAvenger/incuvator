* General Information
  libfuse is a library intended for the GNU Hurd trying to imitate the
  API of the fuse library, available from http://fuse.sourceforge.net, for
  Linux. It's based on Hurd's libnetfs and tries to bring all the fuse based
  virtual filesystems over to the Hurd.

** Fuse Low-Level API
   The low-level API will not be supported by libfuse/Hurd for the
   time being. This is simply because it is to specific to the Linux
   kernel and (besides that) it is not farly used now.

   In case the latter should change in the future, we might want to
   re-think about that issue though.

   This is, you will not succeed in compiling the hello_ll.c example
   from the example-24 directory.

* Dependencies
  Actually none, besides libnetfs. However you should have installed
  that anyways (maybe missing just the header files).

* Installation
  ./configure
  make
  make install

  For more details see the INSTALL file in this directory.
 
* How To Use
  Translators linked against libfuse/Hurd don't work exactly like on
  the Linux operating system. To be more precise: you need to install
  them using settrans.

  Some filesystems check for the availibility of a command line
  argument, which they want to pass to libfuse, and simply fail, if
  you don't supply it. This is because on Linux you call the
  translator as a program as such and specify the mount-point as the
  first argument. 

  If the fuse-based translator insists on that argument, just provide
  any useless information (maybe the correct path). This one will not
  be treated (at least by libfuse). 

  The filesystem will be put on the node you provide to the settrans
  command. Anything else is not of any interest.

  Filesystems that try to export more than one filesystem (I don't
  know of any example, sorry, but these are generally supported by
  Linux's FUSE) will fail on the Hurd. This is because of the settrans
  thing.
