cvsfs4hurd - the CVS virtual filesystem for the GNU Hurd


 what is it?
==========================
   cvsfs4hurd is a virtual (netfs based) filesystem allowing you to mount
   remotly located CVS modules into your local filesystem.  The version
   controlled files will appear to you just like regular ones.  If you just
   want to view one file (or a small bunch) you furthermore save a lot of
   network bandwidth since only these files will be downloaded.  The usual
   way to do so would be to check out the whole tree and deleting it after
   using.


 how to use it?
==========================
   create a directory which you'd like to use as the mount point

     mkdir -p cvsfs_test

   then set up the translator using settrans

     settrans -a /hurd/cvsfs cvs.berlios.de /cvsroot/cvsfs4hurd cvsfs

   the settrans command will take some while to finish since cvsfs tries
   to download the directory tree first.  If the command finished successfully
   just 

     cd cvsfs_test

   to enter the directory.  Feel free to ls, emacs, etc. as long as you'd
   like to ;-)


 it doesn't work! what to do now?
========================================
   cvsfs4hurd is work in progress, I started coding in the middle of
   september 2004, which isn't too far back.  If you stumble over a bug,
   please please either tell me by writing an email or by filing a bug report
   on 

     http://developer.berlios.de/projects/cvsfs4hurd

   Before complaining you probably want to make sure that you're using the
   most recent cvs version.

   Patches against CVS HEAD are welcome as well of course ;)



have fun with cvsf4hurd
 && enjoy the GNU generation ..
