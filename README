To build:

$ make convert
$ make

linux-2.6.29.6 is a mere copy of the drivers/net/ directory of the upstream
source, with just Kconfig and Makefile removed. Upgrading to a newer version
is a matter of unpacking a newer version, changing VERSION in the root
Makefile, and possibly add some sources to the blacklist.
