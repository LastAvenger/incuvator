fuse4hurd - imitation of Linux's libfuse for the Hurd


W H A T   I S   I T ? 
  fuse4hurd is a library intended for the GNU Hurd trying to imitate the
  API of the fuse library, available from http://fuse.sourceforge.net, for
  Linux. It's based on Hurd's libnetfs and tries to bring all the fuse based
  virtual filesystems over to the Hurd. However this results in being quite
  a hack (at least for the time being)
  

H O W   T O   U S E   I T ? 
  simply install fuse4hurd, which will copy a libfuse.{so,la,a} to your
  /local/lib directory. Then simply try to build the fuse-based translator
  as you'd like on Linux. In case it works, please tell - if not, you might
  want to tell as well :-)

 
Have fun with fuse4hurd
  ... and let me hear any suggestions, send patches, etc.
