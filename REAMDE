FILTER TRANSLATOR FOR NSMUX

filter is GNU/Hurd translator designed specifically to be used in
namespace-based translator selection, that is with nsmux. When set on
a file this translator will traverse the stack of static translators
(which sit on the real filesystem node) and stop at the translator
whose name matches the name provided to the filter on the command
line. It will then read and write data using this translator, i.e. all
translators sitting upon this translator and below the filter will be
shunted.
